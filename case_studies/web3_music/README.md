### audit
- install docker
  - since the [eth-security-toolbox](https://github.com/trailofbits/eth-security-toolbox/) container last update was made May 2022 I decided to build it directly from their [github repo](https://github.com/trailofbits/eth-security-toolbox), but since the parent image changed I had to update the Dockefile. Here are the commands to build it 
    ```
    git clone https://github.com/efebia-com/eth-security-toolbox.git
    cd eth-security-security
    docker build -t eth-security-toolbox .
    cd ..
    ```
- run 
    ```
    yarn docker:build
    yarn
    ```
    - run slither
        ```
        slither 
        ```
        to exclude @openzeppelin contracts
        ```
        slither . --filter-paths "./node_modules/@openzeppelin/"
        ```
