# Solidity API

## ERC20Base

_Implementation of the {IERC20} interface.

We have followed general OpenZeppelin Contracts guidelines: functions revert
instead returning `false` on failure.

The non-standard {decreaseAllowance} and {increaseAllowance}
functions have been added to mitigate the well-known issues around setting
allowances. See {IERC20-approve}.

Implementation of the ERC20 Permit extension allowing approvals to be made via signatures, as defined in
https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-2612[EIP-2612].

Support permit.
Support pause.
Support freeze address._

### _allowances

```solidity
mapping(address => mapping(address => uint256)) _allowances
```

### _totalSupply

```solidity
uint256 _totalSupply
```

### __ERC20Base_init

```solidity
function __ERC20Base_init(string name_, string symbol_, string version) internal
```

_Sets the values for {name} and {symbol}.

The default value of {decimals} is 18. To select a different value for
{decimals} you should overload it.

All two of these values are immutable: they can only be set once during
construction._

### __ERC20Base_init_unchained

```solidity
function __ERC20Base_init_unchained(string name_, string symbol_) internal
```

### name

```solidity
function name() public view virtual returns (string)
```

_Returns the name of the token._

### symbol

```solidity
function symbol() public view virtual returns (string)
```

_Returns the symbol of the token, usually a shorter version of the
name._

### decimals

```solidity
function decimals() public view virtual returns (uint8)
```

_Returns the number of decimals used to get its user representation.
For example, if `decimals` equals `2`, a balance of `505` tokens should
be displayed to a user as `5.05` (`505 / 10 ** 2`).

Tokens usually opt for a value of 18, imitating the relationship between
Ether and Wei. This is the value {ERC20} uses, unless this function is
overridden;

NOTE: This information is only used for _display_ purposes: it in
no way affects any of the arithmetic of the contract, including
{IERC20-balanceOf} and {IERC20-transfer}._

### totalSupply

```solidity
function totalSupply() public view virtual returns (uint256)
```

_See {IERC20-totalSupply}._

### transfer

```solidity
function transfer(address to, uint256 amount) public virtual returns (bool)
```

_See {IERC20-transfer}.

Requirements:
- `owner` and `to` cannot be frozen
- `to` cannot be the zero address.
- the caller must have a balance of at least `amount`._

### allowance

```solidity
function allowance(address owner, address spender) public view virtual returns (uint256)
```

_See {IERC20-allowance}._

### approve

```solidity
function approve(address spender, uint256 amount) public virtual returns (bool)
```

_See {IERC20-approve}.

NOTE: If `amount` is the maximum `uint256`, the allowance is not updated on
`transferFrom`. This is semantically equivalent to an infinite approval.

Requirements:

- `spender` cannot be the zero address._

### transferFrom

```solidity
function transferFrom(address from, address to, uint256 amount) public virtual returns (bool)
```

_See {IERC20-transferFrom}.

Emits an {Approval} event indicating the updated allowance. This is not
required by the EIP. See the note at the beginning of {ERC20}.

NOTE: Does not update the allowance if the current allowance
is the maximum `uint256`.

Requirements:

- `from` and `to` cannot be the zero address.
- `from` and `to` cannot be frozen
- `from` must have a balance of at least `amount`.
- the caller must have allowance for `from`'s tokens of at least `amount`._

### increaseAllowance

```solidity
function increaseAllowance(address spender, uint256 addedValue) public virtual returns (bool)
```

_Atomically increases the allowance granted to `spender` by the caller.

This is an alternative to {approve} that can be used as a mitigation for
problems described in {IERC20-approve}.

Emits an {Approval} event indicating the updated allowance.

Requirements:

- `spender` cannot be the zero address._

### decreaseAllowance

```solidity
function decreaseAllowance(address spender, uint256 subtractedValue) public virtual returns (bool)
```

_Atomically decreases the allowance granted to `spender` by the caller.

This is an alternative to {approve} that can be used as a mitigation for
problems described in {IERC20-approve}.

Emits an {Approval} event indicating the updated allowance.

Requirements:

- `spender` cannot be the zero address.
- `spender` must have allowance for the caller of at least
`subtractedValue`._

### _transfer

```solidity
function _transfer(address from, address to, uint256 amount) internal virtual
```

_Moves `amount` of tokens from `from` to `to`

Emits a {Transfer} event.

Requirements:

- `from` cannot be the zero address.
- `to` cannot be the zero address.
- `from` must have a balance of at least `amount`._

### _mint

```solidity
function _mint(address account, uint256 amount) internal virtual
```

_Creates `amount` tokens and assigns them to `account`, increasing
the total supply.

Emits a {Transfer} event with `from` set to the zero address.

Requirements:

- `account` cannot be the zero address._

### _burn

```solidity
function _burn(address account, uint256 amount) internal virtual
```

_Destroys `amount` tokens from `account`, reducing the
total supply.

Emits a {Transfer} event with `to` set to the zero address.

Requirements:

- `account` cannot be the zero address.
- `account` must have at least `amount` tokens._

### _approve

```solidity
function _approve(address owner, address spender, uint256 amount) internal virtual
```

_Sets `amount` as the allowance of `spender` over the `owner` s tokens.

This internal function is equivalent to `approve`, and can be used to
e.g. set automatic allowances for certain subsystems, etc.

Emits an {Approval} event.

Requirements:

- `owner` cannot be the zero address.
- `spender` cannot be the zero address._

### _spendAllowance

```solidity
function _spendAllowance(address owner, address spender, uint256 amount) internal virtual
```

_Updates `owner` s allowance for `spender` based on spent `amount`.

Does not update the allowance amount in case of infinite allowance.
Revert if not enough allowance is available.

Might emit an {Approval} event._

### _beforeTokenTransfer

```solidity
function _beforeTokenTransfer(address, address, uint256) internal virtual
```

_Hook that is called before any transfer of tokens. This includes
minting and burning.

Calling conditions:

- when `from` and `to` are both non-zero, `amount` of ``from``'s tokens
will be transferred to `to`.
- when `from` is zero, `amount` tokens will be minted for `to`.
- when `to` is zero, `amount` of ``from``'s tokens will be burned.
- `from` and `to` are never both zero.

### _afterTokenTransfer

```solidity
function _afterTokenTransfer(address from, address to, uint256 amount) internal virtual
```

_Hook that is called after any transfer of tokens. This includes
minting and burning.

Calling conditions:

- when `from` and `to` are both non-zero, `amount` of ``from``'s tokens
has been transferred to `to`.
- when `from` is zero, `amount` tokens have been minted for `to`.
- when `to` is zero, `amount` of ``from``'s tokens have been burned.
- `from` and `to` are never both zero.

```solidity
function implementation() public view returns (address)
```
