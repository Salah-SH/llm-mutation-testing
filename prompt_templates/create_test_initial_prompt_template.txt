you are a senior software engineer and a smart contract auditor
the goal is the develop a test case for solidity contracts.
this is the solidity contract to test
``` solidity
{contract_code}

this is the mutation operation:
```solidity
{mutant_code}

the above mutant survived these test cases 
``` javascript
{testcases}



your task is to generate exactly one  test case in javascript to kill the solidity mutant.
follow the template of the above test cases. the test file should be executed correctly using hardhat
In mutation testing, the test does not kill the original program but kills the mutant.
describe the steps you followed to generate the right test case that does fail on the mutant but not on the original contract.
there are no automatic getter for the internal variables in solidity .
do not use any proxy contracts. Only use functions that are already defined on the contract
