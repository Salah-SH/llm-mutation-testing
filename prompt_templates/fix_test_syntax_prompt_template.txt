you are a senior software engineer developing tests for solidity smart contracts in Hardhat projects.
I have this testcase
this is the original code before mutation 
``` solidity original contract
{contract_code}

the goal of the testcase is to kill the mutant that is obtained using this mutation oepration:
```solidity mutant contract
{mutant_code}

This is the initial developed tes case
``` javascript buggy testcases
{buggy_testcases}

the tescase is not working, it generated this error:
```error
{error}

locate the mutation operation develop a new test case in javascript to kill the solidity mutant
explain in details the steps you followed in order to come up with the test.
deveop exactly a test file that contains exactly 1 test case to kill the mutant 
handle the correct imports for the test file .
the testcase should compile correctly.
the test should be run using hardhat framework. generate only javascript code

describe the steps you followed to generate the right test case that does fail on the mutant but not on the original contract.
